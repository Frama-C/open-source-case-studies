Introduction
------------

Paparazzi is an attempt to develop a cheap fixed wing UAV (Unmanned Air Vehicle). It develops a complete system hardware and software that may be installed on a variety of aircrafts. It comprises an embedded system and a ground station.
The Paparazzi distribution is only available for a Linux environment but may be configured for several aircraft configurations. 
PapaBench is bound only to the embedded part of Paparazzi and to the default aircraft configuration. This configuration includes a Twinstar3 model-making aircraft, the flight plan used during the first European MAV Flight Competition held in Braunschweig Germany and a classic ground station consisting of the MC3030 radio-command, a radio receiver and a laptop.
The first generation of the embedded system enables us to save the C header files found in sw/var/include directory. These headers are generated from XML files containing the configuration of the airframes, the radio commands and the flight plan.
Then we analyzed the static sources and the generated headers in order to create PapaBench. We have excluded the sources of the ground station in charge of  monitoring the flight, display statistics, programming the mission and generating the embedded system sources.

Top Directoriy description
--------------------------
aadl_sources  :contains the aadl description of PapaBench. Their is four descriptions of the benchmark 
	       since we analyzed four cases for the periodicity of tasks and interruptions.
		- Version 1: Tasks and Interruptions are periodic non preemptive (PnP)
		- Version 2: Tasks are periodic, Interruptions are aperiodic but both non preemptive (PnP, AnP)
		- Version 3: Tasks and interruptions are periodic preemptive (PP)
		- Version 4: Tasks are periodic , interruptions are aperiodic but both preemptive (PP, AP)

avr  : holds the header files of the AVR C libc project

conf : is the configuration directory

sw   : has two sub-directories one for Fly_by_wire source code and the other for autopilot source code

Loops_Bounds.txt  : gives for each loop encountered in the sources its maximum iteration number.

pcg_autopilot.txt and pcg_fbw.txt  :provide the Program Call Graph for the autopilot and the fly_by_wire code respectively


Compilation details
-------------------
Our objective was to enable a user to compile the benchmark without the requirement of the whole Paparazzi building environment and for different architectures. Until now, we have experimented the compilation for PowerPC, x86 and ARM architectures using the gcc compiler suite but it should be easy to adapt PapaBench to other configurations.

***********************************************
*                IMPORTANT                    *
***********************************************
It is important to mention that PapaBench includes header files from the AVR C libc library project containing macros providing access to the AVR hardware registers like IO ports, timers, and so on. As the benchmark does not target hardware simulation, either the hardware registers only matter by their temporal properties, or they may be simply considered as simple memory accesses.
As they are mapped to low addresses (between 0x20 and 0x100), they might be impeding for some platforms where the addresses of interruptions vectors appear at this location. Fortunately, we can get rid of this problem by assigning in the compilation flags a compatible value to the SFR_OFFSET definition, which is the base of the hardware register addresses.


To Compile PapaBench
--------------------

  1) Extract the archive

  2) HAVE A LOOK at conf/Makefile.local
    - select or configure the ARCH (architecture) and MACH (machine) variables in "conf/Makefile.local",
    - configure your compiler tools,
    - configure your CFLAGS and LDFLAGS variable for compilation and linkage options. 

  3) "make" in top directory should compile everything

Multi-processor application
---------------------------

In the default configuration, Papabench produces executable files representing two programs running on two processors. They may be found here:
  - Fly-By-Wire:	PAPABENCH/sw/airborne/fly_by_wire/fbw.elf
  - Autpilot:		PAPABENCH/sw/airborne/autopilot/autopilot.elf

Each application application starts by calling the main function that contains a static scheduling invoking the different tasks with the different frequencies. Each task has an entry point represented as a C function. The table below show the different tasks and their frequencies.

FLY-BY-WIRE
  - check_failsafe_task (20Hz)
  - check_mega128_values_task (20Hz)
  - send_data_to_autopilot_task (40Hz)
  - servo_transmit (20Hz)
  - test_ppm_task (40Hz)
  - __vector_5 (40Hz) -- interruption
  - __vector_6 (20Hz) -- interruption (5 subsequent invocation each 2ms)
  - __vector_10 (40Hz) -- interruption

AUTOPILOT
  - altitude_control_task (4Hz)
  - climb_control_task (4Hz)
  - link_fbw_send (20Hz)
  - navigation_task (4Hz)
  - radio_control_task (40Hz)
  - receive_gps_data_task (4Hz)
  - reporting_task (10Hz)
  - stabilisation_task (20Hz)
  - __vector_5 (10Hz) -- interruption
  - __vector_12 (20Hz) -- interruption
  - __vector_17 (20Hz) -- interruption
  - __vector_30 (4Hz) -- interruption

Mono-processor application
--------------------------

To compile papabench to only one executable file for only one processor, just
add the option PAPABENCH_SINGLE to the "make" command.
	"make PAPABENCH_SINGLE=yes"

We obtain now a lonely executable:
  PAPABENCH/sw/airborne/autopilot/autopilot.elf

The tasks becomes:
  - altitude_control_task (4Hz)
  - check_failsafe_task (20Hz)
  - check_mega128_values_task (20Hz)
  - climb_control_task (4Hz)
  - link_fbw_send (20Hz)
  - navigation_task (4Hz)
  - radio_control_task (40Hz)
  - receive_gps_data_task (4Hz)
  - reporting_task (10Hz)
  - send_data_to_autopilot_task (40Hz)
  - servo_transmit (20Hz)
  - stabilisation_task (20Hz)
  - test_ppm_task (40Hz)
  - __vector_5 (10Hz) -- interruption
  - __vector_6 (20Hz) -- interruption (5 subsequent invocation each 2ms)
  - __vector_10 (40Hz) -- interruption
  - __vector_12 (20Hz) -- interruption
  - __vector_17 (20Hz) -- interruption
  - __vector_18 (40Hz) -- interruption (previously __vector_5 in fly-by-wire)
  - __vector_30 (4Hz) -- interruption

A more formal description of the tasks and their temporal properties expressed in AADL is given in directory "aadl_sources".
