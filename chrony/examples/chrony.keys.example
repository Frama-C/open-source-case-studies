# This is an example chrony keys file.  It is used for NTP authentication with
# symmetric keys.  It should be readable only by root or the user to which
# chronyd is configured to switch to after start.
#
# Don't use the example keys!  It's recommended to generate random keys using
# the chronyc keygen command.

# Examples of valid keys:

#1 MD5 AVeryLongAndRandomPassword
#2 MD5 HEX:12114855C7931009B4049EF3EFC48A139C3F989F
#3 SHA1 HEX:B2159C05D6A219673A3B7E896B6DE07F6A440995
