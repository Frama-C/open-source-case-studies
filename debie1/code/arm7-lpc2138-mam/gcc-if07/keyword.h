/* Integer type definitions for native types that can hold integer
 * values of at least a given number of bits. These types are used
 * as loop counters to give the most natural and speedy code for
 * the current target. This is Not the C99 stdint.h, but the types
 * have similar names.
 *
 * There is a particular form of this file for each (kind of) target
 * processor. The present form is for ARM7/GCC, where the widths of
 * the integer types are the following (as observed from the code of
 * the function Check_Type_Size in harness.c):
 *
 *    Type     Octets  Bits
 *    char       1      8
 *    short      2     16
 *    int        4     32
 *    long       4     32
 *
 * This processor/compiler also has alignment concerns, so here we
 * define all telemetry data as octets and access it using memcpy()
 * instead of direct assignment.
