This folder contains header files and a build script
that compile and link the DEBIE-1 DPU SW benchmark for
execution on an MPC5554 processor. The completed
executable file is also provided.

The generated executable runs the test cases defined
in harness.c once and then stops. The executable does not
generate any output.

This port was contributed by Simon Wegener of AbsInt Angewandte
Informatik GmbH.
