 * This is the new decade counter based servo driving code.  It uses
 * one 16-bit output compare registers to determine when the regular
 * servo clock line should be toggled, causing the output to move to the
 * next servo.  The other 16-bit output compare is used to drive a
 * JR or Futaba compatible high-speed digital servo.
 *
 * User visibile routines:
 *
 * - servo_init();
 *
 * Call once at the start of the program to bring the servos online
 * and start the external decade counters.  This will also start the
 * high speed servo.
 *
 * - servo_make_pulse_width( length );
 *
 * Converts a position value between 0 and 65536 to actual pulsewidth.  0 is
 * all the way left (1.0 ms pulse) and 65536 is all the way right (2.0 ms
 * pulse). Use it like this:
 *
 * servo_widths[ i ] = servo_make_pulse_width( val )
