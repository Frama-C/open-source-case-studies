/** \name Allowing specific system-wide interrupts

    In addition to globally enabling interrupts, each device's particular
    interrupt needs to be enabled separately if interrupts for this device are
    desired.  While some devices maintain their interrupt enable bit inside
    the device's register set, external and timer interrupts have system-wide
    configuration registers. 

    Example:

    \code
    // Enable timer 1 overflow interrupts.
    timer_enable_int(_BV(TOIE1));

    // Do some work...

    // Disable all timer interrupts.
    timer_enable_int(0);
    \endcode

    \note Be careful when you use these functions. If you already have a
    different interrupt enabled, you could inadvertantly disable it by
    enabling another intterupt. */
